# Coding Platform (React.js Only)

This project has been converted to use only React.js (with Create React App) and React Router for navigation. UI and components remain unchanged from the original version.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features
- All UI and logic are preserved from the original project.
- Uses React Router for client-side routing.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Notes
- Vite and Next.js configs have been removed.
- If you see any issues, check your `src` imports and routing in `App.jsx`.
